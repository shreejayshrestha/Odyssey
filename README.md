# Odyssey
Odyssey is a beginner level project written in javascript during the first week of workshop in Audio Programming Course at NTNU. It evolved as an idea of combining differnt sounds in a context of wandering around in a misty jungle. All the sounds have been collected from freesound.org while the beautiful picture of the misty jungle has been borrowed from here: www.selfgrowth.info/WDF-13569.html
